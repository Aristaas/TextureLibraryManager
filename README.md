# TextureLibraryManager
Searches directories and copies to Library

NOTE: This is my first attemp at using github, I'm reletively new to programming and have just started learning c++. So this may look like/be a disaster!

Takes files from from a directory, copies and groups non-dupricate items into a new library directory. 
I also need a way to analyze both the target directory and the library director and rename files that do not follow proper nomenclature rules.
